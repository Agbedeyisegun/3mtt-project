## Below is a paragraph about my experience on shell scripting so far;

Bash scripting is a powerful tool for automating tasks in Unix-like environments, allowing users to execute multiple commands sequentially and handle complex workflows. It begins with basic script creation using #!/bin/bash, defining variables, and leveraging built-in commands like echo, ll, sleep, do, done and grep and all. Conditionals (if, else, elif) enable decision-making, while loops (for loop and while loop) streamline repetitive tasks such as iterating over files or executing commands a set number of times. Advanced scripting integrates functions for modularity and efficiency, redirections (>, >>, |, 2>, &>) for handling input/output, and background execution (&) for multitasking. By combining these techniques, users automate tasks like system backups, log analysis, file manipulation, and even deployment processes, enhancing productivity and reducing manual effort in development and administration workflows learnt to run the script by using `bash` or `./` change the permission with `chmod` .
